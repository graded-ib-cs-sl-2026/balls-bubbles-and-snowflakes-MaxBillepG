# Setting up your Project

1) Open this assignment in visual studio code using the button at the top of the README file! If VS Code is not working, use gitpod by editing the address bar of your github repository and adding "https://gitpod.io/#" before the address.

2) Navigate to the `Sketch.java` file and open it.

3) Click the Play button in the top row and make sure it runs.

You should see a bouncing ball! If not, get help.

## Saving your work

1) Make sure to save often! I use Ctrl-S on windows, you would use Cmd-S on apple computers.

2) To save your work to the cloud, look for the icon on the left that looks like some circles connected by lines. It will probably have a little yellow icon with a number on it - that is the number of changes you have made.
   
3) Type a message in the line that says "Message" that says what you have changed since your last backup. Click the "Commit" button. Once that finished, click the "Sync Changes" button. Ta-da! It is now in the cloud. **You should do this at least once a day**
